## 📍 Project Vision

The United Nations SDGs outline a universal blueprint for equality, sustainability, peace, and global well-being—but many students and younger users are unaware of the goals or what they represent.

This project aims to:
- make SDG knowledge visually engaging
- simplify sustainability learning
- provide a clean intro for education
- promote awareness through interaction

Built with a focus on accessibility, modern visual UX, and minimal friction in navigation.

## 🎯 Component Architecture

- sdg-data.js: SDG information objects
- sdg-card.js: reusable cards
- detail-view.js: modal or details section
- utilities: colors, spacing, typography
- index.html
- style.css
- main.js: entry, UI rendering

## 🧠 Design Approach

The project began as a static SDG reference but evolved into a UI-driven learning interface. Each SDG follows the official color scheme and wording format—allowing familiarity with official SDG branding while offering simplified readability.

Color accessibility and readability were priorities, along with building modular card components that can be expanded into:
- language switching
- quizzes
- SDG facts
- resource links
- additional educational UI modules
